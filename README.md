# A nice way to present your new app features (in SwiftUI)

`WhatsNewView` is a Swift Package for SwiftUI that lets you present to your users your app new features in a pretty way (see screenshots below). For example, when you have released an update and you want to explain what is new.

It is really easy to use and to add to your app. It only takes an array of `WhatsNewFeature` (features to present) as mandatory parameter. All other parameters are here to customize visual aspect and interactions.

## Features

- Title and subtitle
- List of all features with image, title, text
- A Continue button (hiddable)
- A More info button (hiddable)
- Change main color (with light/dark mode)
- Vertical and horizontal orientation
- Methods to handle user interactions
